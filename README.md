# Blazing fast Rust HTTP Server ðŸš€

This repo is a result of my 3-day journey learning [rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I really enjoy this language. Nevertheless, I see fields in which I can be better:

- Borrow checker issues
- String vs &str
- Error handling
- Result object, how to correctly return error

I gained much knowledge by not relying on any network connection library. Developing an understanding of how HTTP Requests are constructed has been enlightening. While I hope to shorten the above list of things I don't know, the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know. Surely this is not a one-time experiment, see you another day Rusty!
